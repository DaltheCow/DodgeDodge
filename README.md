### Background

Dodge Dodge is a time-based, 3D obstacle avoidance game

The player moves forward at an increasing rate (speed increments at distance levels). There are cubes that randomly spawn and the player has to use the arrow keys to steer around them. Score is determined by distance. If you are feeling lucky, try the up arrow key every once in a while and enter into boost mode for bonus points!

###Features

- Smooth and responsive controls make for addictive gameplay.
- Difficulty increases with time and personal high scores are tracked via local storage
- Renders 3D objects at 60fps with three.js library
- Reduces memory load by reusing cube geometries

###Future Direction

- Complex preset cube paths will appear at a certain frequency between the random cube fields
- Node server with MongoDB database for high score Board
- UI changes
  - Background and cube textures will change appearance on level increases
  - Add clouds for more dramatic 3D feel
